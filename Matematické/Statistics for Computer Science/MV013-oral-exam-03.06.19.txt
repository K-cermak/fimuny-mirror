MV013 Statistics for Computer Science: Oral exam on 03.06.19

Two questions, approximately 10-15 minutes preparation on one sheet of paper, then
around 10 minutes oral discussion about the topics.
First question (simple) had almost always something to do with statistical graphics.
Second question (hard) had almost always something to do with statistical inference.

1. Describe a boxplot, what does it show, how can it be used to compare samples, etc.
2. Testing of difference of two means, write down a test statistic (of your choosing),
null and alternative hypotheses, show how to compute and decide on rejection via:
critical region, confidence interval, p-value.

Then quick look-through of the project and possible mistakes in it.
