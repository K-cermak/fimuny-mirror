Hello dear friend from a distant future! These questions are from three exam terms in 2019. GLHF!
------------------

2019 1

- BFR vs kMeans - which sets we keep track of during computation
- Spearman correlation for R1 = (1,2,3,4,5), R2 = (2,5,4,3,1)
- Benefits of Topic Specific Pagerank vs PageRank to compute matrix A
- MapReduce to count total lines across N documents
- Name and describe 3 types of tasks on data streams
- Compute Jaccard similarity on document set. Compute document signatures for given document set. Compute Jaccard similarity on document signatures

------------------
2019 2

- PCY vs A-Priory
- BloomFilter
- MapReduce example
- Pagerank - first iteration
- Cluster distance in noneuclidian space
- Nearness (at least 2 approaches)

------------------
2019 3 (6.6.)

1) Map-Reduce - simple computation on integers [1..8]. Map with 3 transformations: (k+1, v+1), (k, v*2, (k-1, v-1). Reduce as simple sumation for each key
2) Describe steps of k-means algo
3) PCY example (support, buckets, pairs)
4) How DGIM handles 1s?
5) Define Precision and Recall, which of these is better in case of dataset with 10^8 total (10^3 relevant documents). We want to retrieve the 10 most relevant.
6) Advertising example (BALANCE): Bidder A with credit 3 and interest in x,y , bidder B with credit 4 and interest in x,z. Compute on xxxyyzz.
