For each of the following categories give one specific example of a system which belongs to the category and one specific example of a system which does not belong to the category.
Use different examples for each category.
 * hard real time system
 * soft real time system
 * embedded system
 * safety-critical system
Briefly describe relations among these concepts.

A) Compare advantages and disandvantages  of EDF and RM algorihms for periodic scheduling.
B) Consider the following ... of periodic tasks:

    τ_1 τ_2
C_i  x  4
T_i 10  7

 * For each of x from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} determine utilisation factor. Can you determine whether the set is schedulable by EDF/RM without constructing the schedule? Explain.
 * Take the maximal x such that the set is schedulable. Construct the schedule produced by EDF and RM.

[ process 1 ] ---> [ process 2 ]
      ^                  |
      |                  v
[ process 4 ] <--- [ process 3 ]

Consider simple token based protocol for mutual exclusion:
 * There are four processes, initially the first process holds the token.
 * A proces can access critical section only when it holds the token. The process does not need to do so.
 * Token is passed along a ring (see the picture).
 * A process can hold the token for at most 3 seconds; passing of a token is instantaneous.

Your task is to:
 1. Construct a model of a protocol (use a network of timed automata with communication).
 2. Describe a sample run of the model.
 3. Determine a bound B such that the following is true: "If a process wants to go into the critical section it will be able to do so within B seconds."

4. [None. Sorry]

5. (6 points)
Choose a programming language (or choose two programming languages and compare them).
 1. How does the programming language support concurrency? What is the structure, level, and granularity of the programming language?
 2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the programming language with aspect to programming real time systems?
