1) Basic properites of cyclic code, design of generation matrix 
2) Proof corectness of RSA 
3) Fiat-Shamir identification scheme 
4) Encrypt with autoclave (key smth like "abasdsa", text "meetmethisevening") 
5) Hill cryptosystem - you have one word in plaintext and cryptotext and you have to decrypt another cryptotext
